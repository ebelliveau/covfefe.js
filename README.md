## covfefe-JS ~ 

### Excellent for those situations that call for multiple covfefe!
  
Derived from the very well respected konamijs -- https://github.com/snaptortoise/konami-js

This is a total parody, and I have the utmost respect for snaptortoise's implementation of 
the touch interaction, but I may not have much of a use for this.  

I intend to evolve this freak into something that'll bind to every event of every input or 
background DOM element the closure method Covfefe() is pointed towards and returns multiple 
covfefes in many fartscroll.js instantiations.  

## For keks.  
 
I am borrowing things from the snaptortoise konami-js base while I'm barely functional on 
vacation -- at least until this thing does the thing I want it to thing.  
 
Then the deluge of pull requests begins.  Please be gentle, folks.

Go forth and covfefe
